I'm creating a social network with full control over the stack. From the transcendental bridge to L2, to the UI components. No pre-built solutions in critical places.

I'm studying security, cryptography, low-level, network programming, and backend. I'm documenting the path to zero-to-one engineering. I'm writing about science, code, and hardware.

What I'm doing:
• Writing a social network on my own engines
• Digging into Linux, hardware, networks, and cryptography
• Solving LeetCode (427+ problems, 2 problems every day)
• Studying math and CS theory for practical application

What I will share:
• Architectural solutions for social networks
• Scientific notes (crypto, theorver, algorithms)
• Low-level optimization (C, assembler)
• Analysis of complex system problems
• Detailed analysis of hardware
